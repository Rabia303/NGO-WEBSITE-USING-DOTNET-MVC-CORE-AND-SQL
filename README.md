## Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I encountered several challenges that provided valuable learning experiences:

### Challenge 1: Integrating Frontend Technologies
One of the main challenges I faced was setting the template. I found it difficult to add features and pages in it .This took a lot of my time.

#### Solution:
I adopted a modular approach to development, breaking down the template into smaller, manageable components. This allowed for easier customization and integration of new features without disrupting the existing layout.

### Challenge 2: Implementing Backend Functionality
Implementing backend functionality with .NET MVC Core posed another significant challenge. I struggled with setting up the environment and configuring the database connection.

#### Solution:
To address this challenge, I sought guidance from online resources, forums, and documentation. I also reached out to experienced developers for advice and troubleshooting assistance. Through perseverance and experimentation, I successfully configured the backend environment and implemented the required functionality.

### Challenge 3: Managing Admin and User Modules Simultaneously
Simultaneously managing the development of both the admin and user modules proved to be a daunting task. Balancing the requirements and priorities of each module while ensuring seamless integration posed a challenge.

#### Solution:
To tackle this challenge, I adopted an iterative development approach, focusing on implementing essential features first and gradually expanding functionality. I also established clear communication channels between team members working on different modules, enabling effective collaboration and coordination. By breaking down tasks into manageable chunks and prioritizing based on project deadlines, I was able to streamline the development process and deliver both modules within the specified timeframe.
